            an external programming language.

            Id is useful to apply CSS to individualized instances in which distributing
            the effects of {property: value;} outside of a block of code is undesireable.

            Class is useful to Apply CSS to generalized categories where widespread
            distribution of {property: value;} is sought.

            I would also imagine these category types are useful when higher level languages
            are integrated into the semantic structure.

                }

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
            selector {
                text-transform: uppercase 
                    ...         lowercase
                    ...         capitalize
            }

            I don't think you mean using change directory. Pressing enter
             with no commands will show you the dir you're in. Will look up how to find the
